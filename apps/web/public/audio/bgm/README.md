Place your FM-like background music files here:

- `fm_lobby.mp3` (played in lobby pages: `/`, `/pve`, `/deck-builder`, `/fusion-log`, `/profile`)
- `fm_duel.mp3` (played during duel page: `/match`)

Optional fallback names also supported:

- `lobby.mp3`
- `duel.mp3`

Notes:

- Audio starts after first user interaction (browser autoplay policy).
- If files are missing, the game continues normally without BGM.
